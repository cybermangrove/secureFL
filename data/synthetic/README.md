# Generating the Synthetic Data

### Core Ideas

For a detailed explanation, the method for generating synthetic data involves creating data points in a 60-dimensional feature space for classification with 10 distinct classes. It begins by forming a covariance matrix with diminishing variance across dimensions, simulating the decreasing relevance of features. This matrix is used to produce multivariate normal samples with pre-set means. To assign class labels, the method employs a linear model approach, generating weights and biases from normal distributions. Each data point's features are then linearly combined with these weights, plus a bias and a softmax function are applied to determine the data point's class based on the highest probability. This approach models complex, overlapping class distributions in high-dimensional space, aiming to reflect realistic data scenarios for testing machine learning algorithms. In this data generation approach, the class distributions in high-dimensional space are overlapping, meaning the data distributions for different classes are not completely separate but intersect in some dimensions or areas. Since the weights and biases are randomly sampled from a normal distribution, this introduces the possibility of data points having overlapping distributions across multiple classes, simulating the often-ambiguous boundaries between categories seen in real-world data. And through the use of a linear model (weighted sum plus bias) to determine the class labels for each data point, with the softmax function calculating the most probable class.
