def add_laplace_noise(data, epsilon, lower_bound, upper_bound):
    """
    Add Laplace noise to each element in the list for differential privacy.

    Args:
    - data: list of values.
    - epsilon: privacy budget for each element.
    - lower_bound: lower bound of data.
    - upper_bound: upper bound of data.

    Returns:
    - A new list with Laplace noise added to each element.

    In practice, the value of epsilon (Ïµ) is usually within the range of 0.01 to 1, although higher or lower values may also be used in certain circumstances. Smaller values, such as 0.01 or 0.1, provide stronger privacy protection but may significantly reduce the utility of the data. Higher values, like 0.7 or 1, offer weaker privacy protection but preserve more data utility.
